# Railway Ticket Counter Simulation (RTCS)
**Railway Ticket Counter Simulation (RTCS) is an application designed to simulate a ticket window at a railway station.**
**It accepts the number of hours to simulate and predicts some useful information such as**
1. Number of passengers that will arrive at the window
2. Total waiting time of each passenger
3. Total service time of each passenger

This information helps to statistically analyze and take appropriate measures to reduce the waiting time of the passengers at the ticket window. It is a console program developed in C language.
